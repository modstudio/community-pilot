# Pedal

## Background

For some cars, to get stop and go functionality, a comma pedal must be installed in the car. The comma pedal is not created by, sold by or supported by comma.ai. The comma pedal is created by community members and is supported by [popular forks](../software/popular-forks.md).

## Purchase&#x20;

### The New Car Harness Issues

Installing the comma pedal requires connection to the car harness via RJ45.

**The new** [**harness kit**](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) **from comma.ai no longer has a RJ45 port on the harness box, and it has a new harness that is not compatible with the old box.**

Please note that images have not been updated on comma.ai website, so despite the images displaying the old hardware, comma.ai is only selling the new hardware.

To use the comma pedal, a old harness kit, or a community created one that has a RJ45 is needed. Beartech is in the process of creating a new harness that will be compatible with the pedal he sells. &#x20;
