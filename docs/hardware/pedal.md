# Pedal

## Background

To enable stop-and-go functionality in some vehicles, a Comma Pedal must be installed. This pedal is created and supported by community members, not by comma.ai. It is compatible with [popular forks](../software/popular-forks.md) of the software.

## Purchase&#x20;

Beartech

### The New Car Harness Issues

Installing the Comma Pedal requires connection to the car harness via RJ45.

**The new** [**harness kit**](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) **from comma.ai no longer includes an RJ45 port and is incompatible with the old harness box. Note that the images on the comma.ai website still show the old hardware, but only the new hardware is being sold.**

To use the Comma Pedal, you will need an old harness kit or a community-created one with an RJ45 port. Beartech is currently developing a new harness compatible with the pedal he sells. &#x20;
