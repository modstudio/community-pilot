# Harness

## About

The car harness connects the Comma device to the vehicle, allowing it to communicate with the car's computer.

While comma.ai provides harnesses for all supported cars, some models, like Tesla, are not supported. For these, harnesses are available from community membersâ€”see the [#tesla](https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/524328474081755137) channel on the comma.ai Discord server. Community-created harnesses are also available for other use cases.
