# Harness

The car harness connects the comma device to the car, enabling the comma to communicate with the cars computer.&#x20;

While comma.ai sells harnesses for all supported cars, there are cars that are not supported by comma.ai like Tesla, for these cars, harnesses are available from community members. See the [#tesla](https://discord.com/channels/469524606043160576/524328474081755137) channel on comma.ai Discord server.

There also community created harnesses for other use cases.&#x20;
