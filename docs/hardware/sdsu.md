## About

Older Toyota/Lexus vehicles have limited functionality with openpilot due to the limitations in of the built in Driver Support Unit (DSU). For openpilot's longitudinal functionality to work, the DSU must be unplugged.

### Challenges

Unplugging the DSU can cause several issues:

* CAN errors, potentially disabling autopilot entirely.
* Disabling Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB).

### Solutions

This can be resolved in one of two ways

1. Instaling a Smart DSU
2. Getting the DSU "smartened"
