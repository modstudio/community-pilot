## About

Older Toyota/Lexus vehicles have limited functionally via openpilot out of the box due to limitations in the car provided hardware, the DSU.&#x20;

For openpilot longitudinal functionality to work, the DSU must be unplugged.&#x20;

### Challanges

Unplugging the DSU can have a few adverse affects.

1. Unplugging the DSU might cause CAN errors, disabling the use of autopilot entirely.
2. Unplugging the DSU will disable the Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)&#x20;

### Solutions

This can be resolved in one of two ways

1. Instaling a Smart DSU
2. Getting the DSU "smartened"
